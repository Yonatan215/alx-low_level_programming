malloc() --> (memory allocation) A method used to alocate single large blocks of memory with specified size returning a pointer of type void that can be casted to a pointer of any form. Memory is initialized with a default garbage value.

calloc() --> (contiguous allocation) Almost similar to malloc in dynamic memory allocation other than it initializes each block of memory with a defalut value '0' and has two parameters or arguments to compare to malloc(). Since we will not be focussing on calloc here is an example.
